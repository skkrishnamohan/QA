## Core Cloud Concepts

**Agility:**  
Deploy and change resources quickly as needed.

**Resource Hierarchy:**  
Azure uses management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources to organize everything.

**Resource Groups:**  
Logical containers for resources that share the same lifecycle.

**Resources:**  
Individual Azure services like VMs, storage, or databases.

**Defense-in-depth:**  
Multiple layers of security to protect data.

**Elasticity:**  
Automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.

**Expenditure Models:**  
- **OPEX:** Pay for what you use (cloud model).
- **CAPEX:** Pay upfront for hardware (traditional IT).

**Geo-distribution:**  
Deploy apps and data globally for better performance.

**High Availability:**  
Design systems to keep running even if something fails.

**Scaling:**  
- **Horizontal:** Add/remove servers.
- **Vertical:** Increase/decrease server power.

**Public Cloud:**  
Shared infrastructure, scalable, and accessible online.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA):**  
Azure guarantees uptime and performance for services.

**Service Models:**  
- **IaaS:** Infrastructure as a Service
- **PaaS:** Platform as a Service
- **SaaS:** Software as a Service

**Single Sign-On (SSO):**  
Sign in once to access multiple resources.

**Virtual Network Peering:**  
Connect two Azure networks for seamless communication.
